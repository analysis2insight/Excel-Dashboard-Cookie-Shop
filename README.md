## Project Overiew
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data related to cookie company sales.  The goal was to easily visualize the companies revenue over time, customer satisfaction, and the acquisition of customers.   

## Dashboard 
An Excel dashboard was created to present key findings and visualizations from the data analysis. The dashboard includes interactive charts, and graphs to provide an intuitive and comprehensive view of the data.  The data can be sliced multiple ways to drill down on specific data.  Behind the main dashboard are pivot tables that aggregate and summarize the data to allow dynamic grouping and filtering and calculations.  

## Insights and Recommendations:
Over the last 3 years the company revenue has been consistent but stagnate.  This may be due to the decrease in total customers from year to year.  Over the three years there has been a 17% decrease in the number of customers.  It can also be seen that the customer satisfaction has also dropped over the years.   There is no type of cookie driving the changes as similar sales and customer decrease are seen across all cookie types.  

Recommend to evaluate ingredient changes or pricing changes that may be driving customer dissatisfaction.  Recommend to evaluate ad campaign as it is not attracting new business.
